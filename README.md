**[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)** is an educational community for computer programming.

The platform has programming exercises to train a range of skills in a variety of programming languages, and are completed within an online integrated development environment.

This repository is to keep reunited the challenges I solve at the platform and to keep track of my development in the Java language.
